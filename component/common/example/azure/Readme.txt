Microsoft Azure IoT Examples based on Azure Embedded C SDK and MQTT stack


Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Azure examples here are designed to communicate with Azure IoT Hub and Azure IoT Provisioning Service and perform all required action
to interact with Azure IoT Service. These examples are based on Azure Embedded C SDK and utilize our own MQTT stack. We introduce all sorts 
of examples including Telemetry, Cloud-to-Device, Direct Methods, Device Twins, Device Provisioning and Plug and Play, and show X509 and 
SAS authentication supported by Azure IoT Service.


Prerequisites
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Azure Account need to be created.
2. Azure IoT Hub need to be setup on your Azure Account and a x509/SAS iot device needs to be setup on your IoT Hub.
3. Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service (DPS) need to be setup on your Azure Account if running iot provisioning examples.
4. Azure IoT Explorer need to be installed in order to interact with examples. 
	[https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-explorer/releases]
5. A pair of X509 certificate and private key need to be prepared for examples using X509 authentication. You can refer to 
	"Create a Device Using X.509 Self-Signed Certificate Authentication" section on azure-sdk-for-c on github:
	[https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c/blob/master/sdk/samples/iot/README.md]
6. Azure IoT Central is an integrated platform to simplify the IoT Service management and operation. You can also test AmebaD IoT Hub Plug and Play Examples with Azure IoT Central to easily get start with AmebaD Plug and Play service.


Getting Start
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
1. Include Azure example codes for building
[GCC]
	i. Rename application.is.azure.mk to application.is.mk under GCC-RELEASE folder so that we will default build Azure project when we run the makefile. This makefile includes MQTT stack, Azure Embedded C SDK and all Azure IoT Examples.
[IAR]
	i. Rename application_is_azure.ewp to application_is.ewp under EWARM-RELEASE folder so that project_is.eww will default read Azure project. This .ewp file includes mqtt stack, azure embedded c sdk and all azure iot examples.

2. Enable CONFIG_EXAMPLE_AZURE in [inc_hp\platform_opts.h] to start the example.
3. Select example in [example_azure_iot_entry.h] and configure your own setting in the example. Please refer to the "Azure Example Description" and "Realtek Pnp Example Description"section.
4. If you are using X509 certificate encrypted with EC cryptography, please enable below define in [config_rsa.h]. (Default use MbedTLS-2.4.0)
	MBEDTLS_KEY_EXCHANGE_ECDHE_ECDSA_ENABLED
	MBEDTLS_ASN1_WRITE_C
	MBEDTLS_ECDH_C
	MBEDTLS_ECDSA_C
	MBEDTLS_ECP_C

Next, Build and flash your image to the EVB.
When example start running
	1. Use AT command to connect to WiFi manually. Input the below command step by step on terminal. After WiFi connected the example will proceed.
		ATW0=[your AP ssid]
		ATW1=[your AP passphrase. Exclude this command if AP is OPEN mode]
		ATWC
	2. Check the example and interact with it.

Azure IoT Service Configuration
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here we introduce some required steps to prepare for your IoT Service. For Azure IoT Examples, it is recommended to set up Azure IoT Hub and DPS on your Azure Service Portal for testing. And for AmebaD IoT Hub Plug and Play Examples, you can either choose to connect to Azure IoT Hub/DPS or connect to Azure IoT Central for more simple deployment.

	Azure IoT Hub and DPS
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	IoT Hub and DPS can be created on your Azure Portal. You can performed the following steps to setup your own IoT Service on Azure Portal and manage your resources.
	1. Create your IoT Hub on Azure Portal. Once created, you will be able to retrieve your IoT Hub hostname on your IoT Hub menu. This IoT Hub hostname is required for Azure examples in our SDK and will be filled in HUB_HOSTNAME in the example.
	2. Now you can add a device to your IoT Hub by either manually adding or by device provisioning. You have to specify the Device ID for your device and choose Symmetric key or X.509 for device connection if you add the device manually. If you use device provisioning, the Device ID will be assigned by DPS which will be same as the Registration ID of the device enrollment. Also, the registered device will keep the same authentication type as the DPS device enrollment.
	Once you have your device created, you can run the Azure example to connect your device to IoT Hub by giving HUB_HOSTNAME, device id as HUB_DEVICE_ID, connection authentication type either Symmetric key as HUB_SAS_KEY or X.509 certificate/private key as X509CERTIFICATE/ X509PRIVATEKEY.
	3. Create your Device Provisioning Services (DPS) on Azure Portal and have your device enrollment ready. The ID scope of the DPS and the Registration ID of device enrollment will be use in Azure Examples as ID_SCOPE and REGISTRATION_ID. Here we introduce individual enrollment only. When you add individual enrollment to your DPS, you can select Symmetric Key or X.509 mechanism.
	[SAS]
		For Symmetric Key (SAS), you have to specify the Registration ID, IoT Hub Device ID and IoT Hub hostname you want to assign to. The Primary key will be auto generated and will be used in the Azure examples as SAS_KEY. Once device provisioning is done, the device with name as your IoT Hub Device ID will be registered to your IoT hub. The registered device will use the same symmetric key for connection.
	[X509]
		For X.509, you have to specify the IoT Hub Device ID and IoT Hub hostname you want to assign to. Also, you need to select the X509 certificate file you have for provisioning.
		Please note that:
		i. Registration ID for X.509 individual enrollment is retrieved from the X.509 certificate Subject Name.
		ii. For the X509 certificate used for iot provisioning, please make sure your x509 certificate is create with x509 v3 extension.
			X509v3 Basic Constraints: CA:FALSE
			X509v3 Key Usage: Digital Signature, Non Repudiation, Key Encipherment
		To connect to DPS with X.509 enrollment, you will need to provide X509 certificate and private key as X509CERTIFICATE and X509PRIVATEKEY in your examples. Once device provisioning is done, the device with name as your IoT Hub Device ID will be registered to your IoT hub. The registered device will use the same X.509 certificate for connection.

	Azure IoT Central
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Azure IoT Central is an integrated platform for users to develop their Azure IoT Service. You can customize your IoT solution on this platform and manage your IoT resource easily and gracefully.
	First, you have to create an application on your Azure IoT Central and then select and publish AmebaD device on Device Template. Next, navigate to Devices and create a new device. For individual enrollment, follow the steps below to setup your device connection.
	1.	Click on you device.
	2.	Click on the Connect icon on your device page, you will see the Device connection window pops up.
	3.	Select Individual enrollment on the Authentication type.
	4.	Choose Shared access signature (SAS) or Certificate (X.509) on the Authentication method.
	5.	Enter the SAS Primary key or Upload the X.509 Certificate. There are some tips for creating the SAS key and X.509 Certificate in the below link.
		[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-central/core/concepts-get-connected#create-individual-enrollments]
	Now you can filled in the connection information to AmebaD IoT Hub Plug and Play examples where ID scope as ID_SCOPE, Device ID as REGISTRATION_ID, SAS key as SAS_KEY and X509 certificate/private key as X509CERTIFICATE/X509PRIVATEKEY.

Realtek Pnp Example Description
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AmebaD IoT Hub Plug and Play examples are the application responsible for communication between AmebaD components and Azure IoT service. 
Basically there are two examples in our sdk, example_azure_iot_rtk_pnp_x509 and example_azure_iot_rtk_pnp_sas, who done the exactly same things except the authentication type of connection to DPS and IoT Hub.
After Wi-Fi is connected, the example will proceed. At the beginning of the example, it will connect to your DPS and register the device to your iothub. 
If succeed, you should see your device shown on Azure IoT Explorer. Next, the example will connect to your IoT Hub and start the plug and play process for AmebaD:

1.	MQTT Subscribe for command, device twins desired property and response.
2.	Initial all components. If there is some initial values or read only properties that you would like to initialize, you can do at this part.
3.	Update reported properties for all components for the first time and then send a twins document request to check the device status on IoT Hub.
4.	Start the telemetry thread. This thread is responsible for all component telemetry.
5.	Start receiving the messages that are subscribed from IoT Hub. AmebaD will then react to the incoming message, complete the proper operation to the corresponding component and response to IoT Hub.

To enable the examples in our AmebaD sdk:

After AmebaD IoT Hub PnP examples are successfully executed, you can check your registered device on Azure IoT Explorer where its “IoT Plug and Play device” column shows dtmi:realtek:rtk_ameba_series;1.
Next, you can check all components on Azure IoT Explorer and interact with AmebaD.
There are four types of interfaces you can check on each component. Click in any component on the “IoT Plug and Play components” page, you will see the component details.

	[Property] The read-only property. You can check the properties in the “Properties (read-only)” tab.
	[Writable Property] The writable property. You can modified writable properties in the “Properties (writable)” tab.
	[Telemetry] The telemetry. You can see the telemetry messages received in the “Telemetry” tab.
	[Command] The commands. You can send commands in the “Commands” tab.

Realtek plug and play model files are placed on Realtek folder of Microsoft Public Repository, which are defined with Digital Twins Definition Language (DTDL):
	[https://github.com/Azure/iot-plugandplay-models/tree/main/dtmi/realtek]
The model files are divided into several components. Each component represents a feature of the device and details its telemetry, property and command to interact with Azure IoT service. 
Here we briefly introduce each component of AmebaD.
