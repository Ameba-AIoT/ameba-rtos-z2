802.1X EAP METHOD SUPPLICANT EXAMPLE

Description:
Use 802.1X EAP methods to connect to AP and authenticate with backend radius server.
Current supported methods are EAP-TLS, PEAPv0/EAP-MSCHAPv2, and EAP-TTLS/MSCHAPv2.

Customer Configuration:
	Please refer to following steps to change mentioned files to build eap example:
	
	[platform_opts.h]
		# define CONFIG_EXAMPLE_EAP	1

		// Turn on/off the specified method
		# define CONFIG_ENABLE_PEAP	1
		# define CONFIG_ENABLE_TLS	1
		# define CONFIG_ENABLE_TTLS	1
		
		// If you want to verify the certificate of radius server, turn this on
		# define ENABLE_EAP_SSL_VERIFY_SERVER	1

	[example_entry.c]
		// turn on one of the eap methods, one method supported at one time
		example_eap("tls");
		//example_eap("peap");
		//example_eap("ttls");
		
	[example_eap.c]
		Modify the connection config (ssid, identity, password, cert) in example_eap_config() of example_eap.c based on your server's setting.
		details in example_eap.c
		
		eap_target_ssid;
		eap_identity;
		eap_password;
		eap_ca_cert;
		eap_client_cert;
		eap_client_key;
		eap_client_key_pwd;

	[main_s.c]
		Modify the client key in secure (only for TZ).
		client_key_s;

	[mbedtls/config.h]
		Make sure the config_rsa.h of mbedtls include the SSL/TLS cipher suite supported by radius server.
		choose config_rsa.h or config_all.h base on server's setting
		turn on and off related marcos in the config file you choose base on the key and cipher used

	[lib_wlan*.a]
		For Ameba-z2
			rename lib_wlan_eap.a/lib_wlan_eap_ns.a to lib_wlan.a/lib_wlan_ns.a and rebuild the image
		For Ameba-z2plus
			rename lib_wlan_eap_z2plus.a/lib_wlan_eap_ns_z2plus.a to lib_wlan_z2plus.a/lib_wlan_ns_z2plus.a and rebuild the image

Execution:
An EAP connection thread will be started automatically when booting.

Note:
If the connection failed, you can try the following directions to make it work:
1. Check format key format and corresponding mbedtls marcos. The key format generated by the latest openssl is PKCS#8 which is not supported by mbedtls.
	for example PKCS#8 start with  
	"-----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----\r\n" \
	"MIIEvgIB...."
	in this case need to use openssl to convert it to old style key format or decrypt key first
	for example using "openssl rsa -in client.key -out dec_client.key"
	and use the dec_client.key
2. Set a larger value to SSL_MAX_CONTENT_LEN in config_rsa.h
3. Make sure lib_wps.a is linked in to avoid compile error. However CONFIG_WPS in SDK\component\common\drivers\wlan\realtek\include\autoconf.h is not necessary
4. Try to change using SW crypto instead of HW crypto.
