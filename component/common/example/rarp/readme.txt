Attached to: [Bridged Adapter]

You may want to update your ubuntu firewall configuration:
sudo apt install ufw
sudo ufw allow 2222/tcp
sudo ufw allow 2323/tcp
sudo ufw allow from AmebaZ2_IP_Address to any port 219
sudo ufw allow from Server_IP_Address to any port 219

RARP server:
For Ubuntu, you can try to setup the RARP server as doing this:
apt-get install rarpd
touch /etc/ethers
Add	Ameba's MAC address such as "00:e0:4c:87:00:09	client"		in /etc/ethers
Add	Ameba's IP  address such as "192.168.0.100			client"		in /etc/hosts
sudo rarpd -A
Note:
IPv4 uses rarp while IPv6 uses neighbor discovery (ND)Â packets to find out the hardware MAC address.
