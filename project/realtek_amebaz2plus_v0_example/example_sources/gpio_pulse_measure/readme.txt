Example Description

This example describes how to use GPIO read/write mbed api to generate a pulse and to measure the pulse width.

Requirement Components:
    a wire

Pin name PA_19 and PA_20 map to GPIOA_19 and GPIOA_20:
    1, PA_19 as the interrupt GPIO pin with no pull (High-Z).
    2, PA_20 as output to generate a pulse.
    3, Use a wire to connect PA_19 and PA_20

In this example, the UART console will print out the measured width (in us) of the pulse which generated by the interrupt GPIO pin.

Note
    1, Supported GPIO pins, PA_0, PA_1, PA_2, PA_3, PA_4, PA_7, PA_8, PA_9, PA_10, PA_11, PA_12, PA_13, PA_14, PA_15, PA_16, PA_17, PA_18, PA_19, PA_20, and PA_23.
    2, Please off JTAG/SWD, when using PA_0, PA_1, PA_2, PA_3, and PA_4.
    3, Please off log UART, when using PA_15, and PA_16.
    4, PA_7, PA_8, PA_9, PA_10, PA_11 and PA_12 only available on RTL8720CF.
